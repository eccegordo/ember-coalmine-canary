Ember Coalmine Canary
=====================

Let the canaries in before the poison gas kills you. 

This repo is a series of very minimalist ember projects used to isolate issues with ember beta and canary.

The goal is to create examples that pass in one version of Ember but fail when upgrading.

I use this project to try out ideas and test the waters before upgrading ember in my regular projects.
