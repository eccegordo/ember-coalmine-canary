Ember Coalmine Canary
=====================

Let the canaries in before the poison gas kills you. 

This repo is a series of very minimalist ember projects used to isolate issues with ember beta and canary, or specific addons

The goal is to create examples that pass in one version of Ember but fail when upgrading or chainging an addon.

The sub projects here are very minimimalist that show the specific issue in context.

I use this project to try out ideas and test the waters before upgrading ember in my regular projects.
